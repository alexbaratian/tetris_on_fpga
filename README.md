Authors: Alex Baratian and Ieva Bagdonaviciute

This project is a classical Tetris game that uses 7 Tetromino blocks each of which have 4 possible rotations; the rows are cleared once all the blocks are filled in the block. In general, we have used an SoC that utilizes a MicroBlaze processor for taking keyboard inputs through our FPGA board and controlling the rotations of the Tetrominos. This is a final project for ECE 385 - Digital Systems Laboratory.
